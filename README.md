I am currently my schools head of varasity for Linux and am on a journey to become a cybersecurity professional and aquire the CCNA, CompTIA A+, and Azure DevOP certificates. I have a passion for working with hardware, circuitry, and the C programming language.

I love linux and wish to contribute to the main kernel or any forks of the kernel in the future, in addition to managing and creating libre software.
